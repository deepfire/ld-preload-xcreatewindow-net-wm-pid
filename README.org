* What

This is intended to make X applications respect =_NET_WM_PID=, through applying a
post-hook on =XCreateWindow=, =XCreateSimpleWindow= and =XReparentWindow= via =LD_PRELOAD=.

* Using with XMonad

  This closes one more gap in reliable placement of application windows at desired
  workspaces.

  Basically, the following is what works for me:

  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  spawnOn name $ "{ export LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/ld-preload-xcreatewindow.so; " ++ cmd ++ "; }"
  #+END_SRC

* Known issues

  Sometimes, =dlsym()= fails to return the original value of the hooked symbol,
  for example this is what I see with QuodLibet on NixOS as of early 2016.
